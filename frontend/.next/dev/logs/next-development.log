We should consider a more memory-efficient approach.","id":978,"orderIndex":0,"question":"What happens if this API gets 10,000 requests per second?"},{"answer":"You could divide time into buckets and store counts instead of timestamps. Sliding Window Counter - divide window into smaller buckets, store count per bucket, sum recent buckets. This achieves O(k) space where k = number of buckets, independent of traffic.","id":979,"orderIndex":1,"question":"Can you think of a solution that uses fixed memory regardless of traffic?"},{"answer":"Current solution is precise but uses O(n) memory. Fixed-memory solutions are approximate but use O(1) memory. Current solution trades precision and simplicity for memory usage. Fixed-memory solutions like sliding window counter offer better scalability but sacrifice precision at bucket boundaries.","id":980,"orderIndex":2,"question":"What's the tradeoff between your current solution and a fixed-memory solution?"},{"answer":"You would need to store the rate limiter state in a shared location like Redis. Use Redis or a distributed cache to store the rate limiter state. Handle race conditions with atomic operations or Lua scripts. Consider eventual consistency trade-offs.","id":981,"orderIndex":3,"question":"What if this needs to work across multiple servers?"},{"answer":"Inject the time function so tests don't depend on real time.
